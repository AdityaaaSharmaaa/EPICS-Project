## 📖 Overview

This project is developed as part of the **EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service)** curriculum. It aims to solve two critical issues in rural finance:
1.  **Accessibility:** Providing a simple, low-bandwidth digital payment interface for users with limited tech literacy.
2.  **Creditworthiness:** Establishing a "Community Credit Score" system that leverages transaction history and community trust factors to enable micro-lending for individuals without formal banking history.

## ✨ Key Features

* ** Simplified Digital Wallet**: Easy-to-use interface for sending and receiving money, optimized for rural connectivity.
* ** 📊 Community Credit Score**: A proprietary algorithm that calculates a dynamic credit score based on repayment habits and community endorsements.
* ** 📱 Offline/Low-Data Mode**: Core features designed to function efficiently in areas with unstable internet connections.
* ** 🔐 Secure Transactions**: End-to-end encryption for all financial data.
* ** 👥 Community Groups**: Support for Self-Help Groups (SHGs) to manage pooled funds and internal lending.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
* **Language**: TypeScript
* **State Management**: React Context API / Redux (Planned)
* **Navigation**: React Navigation
* **Styling**: StyleSheet / NativeBase
